# AdminAreaProtection Plugin Improvement Plan

## Overview

The AdminAreaProtection plugin is a Nukkit plugin that allows server administrators to create protected areas with customizable permission settings. Recent changes have introduced MobPlugin integration, reorganized the configuration management, and made performance optimizations. This plan outlines the necessary improvements to fix bugs, optimize performance, and ensure language key consistency.

## Key Components

1. **Core Systems**
   - Area Management (creation, modification, querying)
   - Permission System (area-specific permissions, LuckPerms integration)
   - GUI System (forms for user interaction)
   - Event Handling (protection enforcement)

2. **Recent Changes**
   - Added MobPlugin support for monster targeting
   - Moved ConfigManager from `adminarea.config` to `adminarea.managers`
   - Added cache invalidation for permissions
   - Performance optimizations in entity and area checks
   - New utility class for handling monsters

## Issues to Address

### 1. Missing Language Keys
- Ensure all hard-coded messages in code reference valid keys in the language files
- Add missing keys identified in code
- Harmonize keys between different handlers
- Check for inconsistencies between message references and actual key names

### 2. Bug Fixes
- Fix MobPlugin integration and ensure proper monster targeting behavior
- Address cache invalidation issues in the PermissionChecker
- Fix inconsistencies in area overlap checking
- Correct any form handling issues after recent changes

### 3. Optimizations
- Improve entity handling performance with caching mechanisms
- Optimize permission checking by reducing redundant operations
- Enhance area queries with spatial indexing improvements
- Reduce unnecessary object creation during common operations

### 4. Code Structure Improvements
- Clean up deprecated methods and classes
- Ensure consistent error handling
- Improve documentation and code comments
- Make folder structure more consistent (ConfigManager move)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Language Key Fixes
1. Analyze all message references in code
2. Compare with language file keys
3. Add missing keys to language files
4. Update references in code to use consistent key names

### Phase 2: Bug Fixes
1. Test and fix MobPlugin integration issues
2. Correct permission checking bugs
3. Fix form handling issues
4. Address area boundary checking problems

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Implement better caching for common operations
2. Reduce object creation in critical paths
3. Optimize permission checking logic
4. Improve area querying performance

### Phase 4: Code Structure
1. Rename and refactor classes for consistency
2. Update imports after ConfigManager move
3. Clean up deprecated code
4. Improve error handling and logging

## Priority Issues

Based on initial analysis, these are the top priority issues to address:

1. **Missing language keys in notification messages**
2. **MobPlugin integration bugs in EntityListener**
3. **Permission cache invalidation in AreaManager**
4. **Form handling issues in DeleteAreaHandler and BasicSettingsHandler**
5. **Performance issues in area boundary checking**
